# Bug Bounty For Beginners 

**What is Bug Bounty?** - A Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRB), also known as bug bounty, Offers financial rewards to individuals for finding and reporting software bugs.

## How It Works
Companies create financial incentives through online programs to independent bug bounty hunters (researchers) as part of a vulnerability management strategy. This is used to supplement penetration tests and internal code audits.
- **Penetration Test**: An authorized, simulated cyber attack performed on a computer system to evaluate its security.
- **Internal Code Audits**: A comprehensive analysis of source code in a programming project with the intent of discovering bugs, security breaches, or violations of programming conventions.
- **Programming Conventions**: A set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommends programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that langguage.

## Downside to Bug Bounty
Doesn't guarantee coversge for all types of vulnerabilities
Can be stressful and time-consuming
Prices can vary
- Low: $~150
- Med: $~500
- high: roughly $1,000 to $3,000

## What You Should Learn
**Computer Networking**: Fundamentals of inter-networking, IP and MAC addresses, ISO stack, TCP/IP stack, etc

**Web Technologies**: Basic understanding (beginner to intermediate is fine) of:
### Web progranning
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
### Protocols
- HTTP/HTTPS
- FTP
- TLS

**Web App Security Measures**: Security mechanisms, practices, bypasses, vulnerabilities (common in web apps) and gow to find/patch/prevent these apps from the vulnerabilities.
