## Domain 1: System Management (23%)

### 1.1 Explain Basic Linux Concepts

#### Basic Boot Process
- **Bootloader**:
  - The bootloader is the first software loaded by the system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) to initialize the operating system.
  - Examples: GRUB, LILO, Syslinux.
  - **Configuration files**
    - GRUB configuration: `/etc/default/grub`, `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`.
    - Common parameters include specifying kernel images and default OS.
- **Kernel**:
  - The core of the operating system, responsible for managing hardware resources and providing system services.
  - **Parameters**:
    - Passed via the bootloader using the `cmdline` (e.g., `cat /proc/cmdline`).
    - Examples: `root=/dev/sda1` (root filesystem), `quiet` (reduce boot messages), `nomodeset` (disable graphics mode).
- **Initial RAM Disk (initrd)**:
  - A temporary root filesystem loaded into memory by the bootloader.
  - Used to initialize hardware and load modules required for mounting the real root filesystem.
- **Preboot Execution Environment (PXE)**:
  - A network boot protocol that allows a system to boot from a server over the network.
  - Common in diskless environments or for large-scale deployments.

#### Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
- **/**: - The root directory, the starting point of the entire filesystem.
- **/bin**: - Essential binaries required for all users (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`).
- **/boot**: - Contains boot-related files like the kernel and GRUB configuration.
- **/dev**: - Device files representing hardware (e.g., `/dev/sda`, `/dev/null`).
- **/etc**: - System configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/fstab`).
- **/home**: - Home directories for regular users (e.g., `/home/user1`).
- **/lib**: - Shared libraries needed by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
- **/proc**: - Virtual filesystem for process and kernel information (e.g., `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`).
- **/sbin**: - System binaries for administrative tasks (e.g., `fsck`, `reboot`).
- **/tmp**: - Temporary files that are cleared on reboot.
- **/usr**: - Secondary hierarchy for user applications and utilities (e.g., `/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`).
- **/var**: - Variable files like logs (`/var/log`) and caches (`/var/cache`).

#### Server Architectures

- **AArch64**:
  - A 64-bit architecture used in ARM-based devices.
  - Common in energy-efficient servers, mobile devices, and IoT.

- **Reduced Instruction Set Computer, Version 5 (RISC-V)**:

- **Wayland**:
  - A modern replacement for X Server, offering simpler and more secure protocols.
  - Supported by environments like GNOME and KDE.

#### Software Licensing

- **Open Source Software**:
  - Software with source code that is freely available for modification and redistribution.
  - Example licenses: Apache, MIT, GPL.

- **Free Software**:
  - Focuses on user freedoms: to run, study, modify, and share software.
  - Example: Free Software Foundation (FSF).

- **Proprietary Software**:
  - Software with source code that is not available to the public.

## 1.7 Summarize Virtualization on Linux Systems

### Linux Hypervisors
- **Quick Emulator (QEMU)** - A generic and open-source machine emulator and virtualizer. It can perform full system emulation for different architectures and is used with KVM for virtualization.
- **Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)** - A Linux kernel module that allows the kernel to act as a hypervisor. KVM turns Linux into a Type 1 hypervisor, supporting full hardware virtualization.

### Virtual Machines (VMs)
- **Paravirtualized Drivers** - Specialized drivers designed for communication between the host and guest OS in virtualized environments, providing better performance than fully virtualized setups.
  
- **VirtIO** - A set of paravirtualized device drivers for KVM virtual machines. It allows guest operating systems to interact with the hypervisor with improved performance for disk, network, and other I/O devices.

- **Disk Image Operations**
  - **Convert**: Change the format of virtual disk images (e.g., from `.qcow2` to `.vmdk`).
    ```bash
    qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O vmdk source.qcow2 destination.vmdk
    ```
  - **Resize**: Change the size of a disk image.
    ```bash
    qemu-img resize disk.qcow2 +10G
    ```
  - **Image Properties**: View properties of a disk image.
    ```bash
    qemu-img info disk.qcow2
    ```

- **VM States**
  - **Running**: VM is actively running.
  - **Paused**: VM execution is temporarily halted.
  - **Shut Down**: VM is powered off.
  - **Saved**: VM state is saved for later resumption.

- **Nested Virtualization** - The ability to run a virtual machine inside another virtual machine. This is useful for creating test environments with hypervisors inside VMs.

### VM Operations
- **Resources**
  - **Storage**: Virtual machines use virtual disks, which may be stored as files on the host filesystem or raw device partitions.
  - **RAM**: The amount of system memory allocated to the VM. It can be adjusted to suit the needs of the virtualized operating system.
  - **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: The number of virtual CPUs allocated to the VM.
  - **Network**: Network interfaces are configured for VMs to communicate with the host and other VMs.
- **Baseline Image Templates* - A pre-configured virtual machine image used as a starting point for creating new virtual machines. These images can be customized and saved for repeated use.
- **Cloning** - Creating an identical copy of an existing VM, including all settings and installed applications. Cloning is often used for rapid deployment of multiple VMs.
- **Migrations** - The process of moving a running VM from one physical host to another without interrupting its operation. This allows for load balancing and maintenance without downtime.
- **Snapshots** - A snapshot captures the state of a VM at a specific point in time. This allows users to revert back to that state later, making it useful for testing and backup purposes.

### Bare Metal vs. Virtual Machines
- **Bare Metal** - Refers to physical hardware running an operating system directly. No virtualization layer is involved, offering the best performance.
- **Virtual Machines** - Virtual machines run on top of a hypervisor, which in turn runs on the host operating system. VMs share the underlying hardware resources but offer isolation and flexibility at the cost of some performance overhead.

### Network Types
- **Bridged** - The virtual machine's network interface is directly connected to the physical network, as if it were a physical machine on the same network.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT)** - The VM uses the host's network interface and is isolated from the external network. The VM accesses external resources through the host's IP.
- **Host-only/Isolated** - The VM can communicate with the host but not with the outside world. This is useful for testing and isolated environments.
- **Routed** - VMs are connected to a routed network, allowing for more complex network setups with multiple subnets.
- **Open** - Typically used for more flexible and configurable network setups, such as for virtualization environments like OpenStack.

### Virtual Machine Tools
- **libvirt** - A toolkit used for managing virtualized platforms. It abstracts and simplifies the management of virtualization technologies like KVM, QEMU, and Xen. 
- **virsh** - A command-line interface for managing virtual machines and virtualized environments. It allows users to interact with libvirt.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    virsh list --all
    ```
- **virt-manager** - A graphical interface for managing virtual machines and hypervisors. It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating, managing, and monitoring VMs.

## 5.5 Given a Scenario, Analyze and Troubleshoot Performance Issues

### **Common Symptoms**
- **Swapping**: The system is running low on memory and starts using swap space, which can slow down performance.
- **Out of Memory**: The system has exhausted available memory, leading to performance degradation or crashes.
- **Slow Application Response**: Applications are taking too long to respond, often due to resource contention or configuration issues.
- **System Unresponsiveness**: The system becomes slow or unresponsive, often due to high CPU, memory, or disk usage.
- **High CPU Usage**: Excessive CPU consumption by one or more processes can degrade system performance.
- **High Load Average**: The average number of processes in the system's run queue is high, indicating resource bottlenecks.
- **High Context Switching**: Excessive context switching between processes can reduce system performance due to CPU time being spent on switching rather than processing.
- **High Failed Login Attempts**: May indicate brute-force attacks or misconfigured authentication services.
- **Slow Startup**: The system takes a long time to boot due to excessive services, system misconfigurations, or hardware failures.
- **High I/O Wait Time**: A sign that the system is waiting for data from storage, which can slow down applications.
- **Packet Drops**: Dropped packets due to network congestion, misconfigurations, or hardware issues.
- **Jitter**: Variability in packet delivery time, often caused by network congestion or issues with real-time applications.
- **Random Disconnects**: Network instability causing intermittent disconnections, often due to network misconfigurations or hardware issues.
- **Random Timeouts**: Network timeouts due to intermittent connectivity issues.
- **High Latency**: Delays in network communication, often caused by congestion, misconfiguration, or network hardware issues.
- **Slow Response Times**: Longer-than-normal response times for network or system requests.
- **High Disk Latency**: Delays in accessing data from the disk, often due to disk I/O bottlenecks.
- **Low Throughput**: Insufficient data transfer rate, possibly due to network or disk bottlenecks.
- **Blocked Processes**: Processes that cannot proceed because they are waiting for resources (e.g., I/O or memory).
- **Hardware Errors**: Failures in physical components, like hard drives or network interfaces, can cause performance issues.
- **Sluggish Terminal Behavior**: Slow response times in the terminal due to resource exhaustion, background processes, or misconfigurations.
- **Exceeding Baselines**: Performance metrics that exceed established baseline levels, indicating potential problems.
- **Slow Remote Storage Response**: Delays in accessing storage over the network, often caused by network issues or overloaded storage systems.
- **CPU Bottleneck**: The CPU is a limiting factor for performance, possibly due to inefficient processes or insufficient processing power.
