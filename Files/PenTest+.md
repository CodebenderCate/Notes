# <div align="center" dir="auto">My Notes for PenTest+ (2024)</div>
 
There’s no way around it, the [CompTIA PenTest+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/pentest) certification is a LOT Of information to absorb — especially in a short time. I only just began my course through [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cybersecurity-information-assurance-masters-program.html) on January 23, 2024, and I plan to pass the exam by or before February 29, 2024.
These are notes I’ve collected throughout my studies, compiled together here in a manner hopefully deemed coherent and simple. I do not take credit for any of it, as the information is all over the internet and not designed or created by me; some of these are copy/paste from open sources. I merely aim to summarize or simplify the content required to pass the PenTest+ certification exam. These notes may be edited/updated as I go.
*Chaos mode activated*

## Areas to Study
First, I did some research online to learn from others who have already passed the exam, to discover which areas of the exam required more focus. Here is what I found:

## Web Application Testing:
- SQL Injection: When input validation and the least privilege principle are not properly implemented, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the website by injecting malicious code to “trick” the website into granting the attacker access. This includes using “OR ‘1’=’1'” in a login form in place of legitimate login credentials.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): When input validation fails while using a browser, an attacker can use XSS to inject a script in the website, such as via the search box, where the victim will input a search term that redirects the browser input to the attacker. The attacker can then gain access to session cookies and use that to capture and exploit sensitive information.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Have you ever gotten a [phishing](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-avoid-phishing-scams) email with a fake link leading to a page that looks legitimate? Yep, that’s what this is. A user clicks the link while already authenticated, and it redirects to the attacker’s website where malicious content is hidden, and the victim unknowingly submits the attacker’s requests for them. Attackers use this method to exploit authentication and manipulate trusted access.

## Wireless Security
